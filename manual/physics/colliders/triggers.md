# Triggers

When a collider is a **trigger**, objects don't bump into it. Instead they pass through it, which the trigger detects. 

You can use this to script events. For example, you can use a trigger to detect when a player character enters a room, and use this in your script to trigger an event.

To make a collider a trigger, in the **Property grid**, under the component properties, select **Is Trigger**.

For an example of how to use triggers, see the [Script a triggered event](../tutorials/script-a-triggered-event.md) tutorial.
