# Colliders

To use physics in your project, add a **collider** component to an entity. Colliders are entities that can bump into one another.

There are three types of collider:

* [static colliders](static-colliders.md) don't move
* [rigid bodies](rigid-bodies.md) are moved around by forces such as collision and gravity
* [characters](characters.md) are controlled by user input

You can also: 

* set the [shape of collider components](collider-shapes.md)
* make [trigger](triggers.md) colliders, and use them to script events when objects pass through them
* constrict collider movement with [constraints](constraints.md)
