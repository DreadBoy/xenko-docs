# Colliders

To use physics in your project, add a **collider** component to an entity. Colliders are entities that can bump into one another.

There are three types of collider:

* [Static colliders](static-colliders.md) don't move.
* [Rigid bodies](rigid-bodies.md) are moved around by forces such as gravity and collisions.
* [Characters](characters.md) are controlled by user input.

You can also: 

* Set the [shape of collider components](collider-shapes.md).
* Make [trigger](triggers.md) colliders, and use them to script events when objects pass through them.
* Constrict collider movement with [constraints](constraints.md).
