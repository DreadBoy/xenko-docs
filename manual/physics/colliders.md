To use physics in your project, add a **collider** component to an entity. Colliders are entities that can bump into one another.

There are three types of collider:

* **[Static colliders](static-colliders.md)**, which don't move 
* **[Rigid bodies](rigid-bodies.md)**, which are moved around by forces such as gravity and collisions
* **[Characters](characters.md)**, which are controlled by user input

You can also make colliders [triggers](triggers.md), and use them to script events when objects pass through them.
