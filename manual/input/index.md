#Input
Players use **Input** devices to interact with game environment. Every game must support at least one input device, otherwise players won't be able to play it.

Xenko handles **Input** entirely via scripts. Xenko supports all common input devices, including mouse, keyboard, gamepad, pointers, gestures, and sensors to receive user inputs.

This section explains various input devices supported by Xenko. You will also learn to handle input devices with **Classes** and their **Properties** and **Methods**.
