Scenes are the **levels of your game**. They are **very important** elements of a game. 
As a level designer, most of the time that you will spend is to build the scenes of your game.

A scene is composed of **entities**, the objects of your level.
An entity can contain one or several **components**.
Each type of component adds a **special property** to your entity.

For example:
- Model Component: add a 3D model to your entity
- Light Component: add a light to your entity
- Audio Component: add a sound to your entity


The following image displays a sample scene with a single Knight and default elements, such as light, background, and camera.

## Overview

The Game Studio provides an easy way to create and **build scenes** for your game.

When you create a new scene, the Game Studio automatically populates it 
with all the required **basic elements** such as a light, a camera, and an skybox.

You can **add entities** to your new scene by simply **drag-and-dropping existing assets** from the asset view to the scene editor. 

You can **translate, rotate, and resize** your scene entities very easily and intuitively using the scene editor **gizmos**.

In the scene editor, you can easily **move around and focus** on specific entities accurately adjust new entities.
