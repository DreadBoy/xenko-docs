# Assets

<span class="label label-doc-level">Beginner</span>

An **asset** is a representation of an element of your game inside Game Studio.

Some assets require resource files. For example, texture assets need an image file and audio assets need audio files. Other types of assets (such as scenes, physics colliders, and game settings) don't use resource files, and can be created entirely in Game Studio.
