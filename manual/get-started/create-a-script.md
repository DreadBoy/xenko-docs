# Create a script

Youâ€™ve created a game and have added some entities to the game. 
Now, you have to **add some scripts** to your game to make your game more dynamic and interesting. 
There are two ways to add a script in Xenko: using **Visual Studio**, and using the **Game Studio**. 
We'll describe both below.

## Create a script in Visual Studio

The first method consists in adding a new script class in the game project from Visual Studio. 
Start by **opening** your game **solution** in Visual Studio by clicking the ![](media/create-a-script-ide-icon.png)(Open in IDE) icon.

You will notice that your game solution is composed of several projects. 
The project ending in **.Game** is **the main project** of your game and should contain all your **game logic and scripts**. 
The **other projects** are the projects containing **platform specific code**. 
Typically you will find in those project the main entry point of your game for the given platform and possibly some OS related code.
The **final extension** name of the projects specify the **targeted platform** (e.g. *.Linux*, *.Android*, *.Windows*, etc).

**To create a script in Visual Studio:**

1. **Add a new class file** in the ```.Game``` project of your game solution. To add a new class, **right-click** on the project, 
   then click **Add** in the context menu, and finally click **New Item**.

2. In *Visual C#* items, select *Class*, **type the name** of your script and then click **Add**.

   A new class is added to your game.

4. **Open the file** that you have created. 
   Make the script is **public** and **derive** from either **AsyncScript** or **SyncScript** manually. 
   Finally **implement** the needed **abstract method(s)**. 
   
Here is an example of what your file might look like when you've done that:

```
	using System;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using SiliconStudio.Core.Mathematics;
	using SiliconStudio.Xenko.Input;
	using SiliconStudio.Xenko.Engine;
	
	namespace MyGame
	{
		public class SampleSyncScript : SyncScript
		{			
			public override void Update()
			{
				if (Game.IsRunning)
				{
					// Do some stuff every frame
				}
			}
		}
	}
```

**Load your new script in Game Studio**

Because your project has been modified outside of Game Studio, Game Studio needs to **reload the new game assembly** to show the changes.

1. **Save your project** and script files
2. Go to the Game Studio.
   
   A popup prompting you for reload of the assemblies.
   
      ![Confirmation message](media/create-a-script-confirmation-message.png)

3. Select **Yes** in the displayed dialog.

   The Game Studio adds your class script to your component list.

3. **Select the assembly** where you have added your script in the *Solution Explorer*.
   You should find your script in the Asset view window, ready to be used.

## Create a script in Game Studio

The second method is to create a script from Game Studio without using any other application.

**To create a script in Game Studio:**

1. On the **Asset view** tab, click **New Assets**, and then click **Scripts**.

2. Select a script type from the **Script Types** list. The new script is added to the **Asset view** tab.

   ![Select script type window](media/create-a-script-script-asset-selection.png)

   ![New script on Asset view tab](media/create-a-script-new-script-asset-view.png)
  

Save your project and go to Visual Studio. You should be able to see the new script that has been added to your project.

```
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using SiliconStudio.Core.Mathematics;
using SiliconStudio.Xenko.Input;
using SiliconStudio.Xenko.Engine;

namespace MyGame
{
	public class BasicAsyncScript : AsyncScript
	{	
		public override async Task Execute()
		{
			while(Game.IsRunning)
			{
				// Do some stuff every frame
				await Script.NextFrame();
			}
		}
	}
}
```
