# Launch Xenko

<span class="label label-doc-level">Beginner</span>

After you install Xenko, the first window you'll see is the **Xenko launcher**.

The launcher lets you **manage and run the different versions of Xenko** that have been installed on your system. 

This page shows you how to use the launcher.

## Install last version of Xenko

The launcher initially prompts to install the latest version of Xenko and the Xenko 
Visual Studio plugin. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using Xenko VS plugin, you can edit your shaders directly from Visual Studio. 
> It also provides **syntax highlighting**, live **code analysis** with validation, **error-checking**, 
> and **navigation**. It is not mandatory to install this plugin, however we recommend to install it. 

Accept the invitation and proceed to the installation.

## Version management

The Xenko launcher allows you to install **multiple versions** of Xenko. Typically you would be 
working with the latest version of Xenko, however it is possible to install an older version 
of Xenko in order to work with an old project. This is needed by the fact that different 
versions of Xenko might contain changes that require old projects to be upgraded.

For bug fix versions, only the last number in the version number is changed. 
Bug fix versions do not contain breaking changes, meaning it is safe, and highly recommended 
to install them. Note that currently these versions cannot be reverted.

To install or upgrade to a new version click the *Download & Install* button on the right 
of the version name. Before proceeding to the installation you can also view the list of changes 
and fixes by clicking on the *Release Notes* button on the left.
