# Materials

**Materials** define the appearance of 3D model surfaces and how they react to light. Without materials, models are simply shapes, blank canvases.

Materials can affect both the geometry of a model (vertex shading) and its pixels (pixel shading).

You can use multiple layers of materials to build more complex materials.

In practice, materials generate partial definitions of shaders integrated as part of the shading of models ([lights and shadows](../lights-and-shadows/index.md)).

## Colors and numbers

In digital images, colors are separated into 4 primary channels:

* R - Red
* G - Green
* B - Blue
* A - Alpha (transparency)

The value of each of these channels is represented by a number... We can add these numbers together to create a broad array of colors...

## Physically-based rendering (PBR)

**Physically-based rendering (PBR)** is the practice of approximating how light works in real life by simulating real-life physics...

## Diffuse

The **diffuse** is the basic color of the material.


we have one category - specular
inside you can decide if it's metallic, or just specular
