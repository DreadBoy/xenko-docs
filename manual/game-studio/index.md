# Game Studio

Game Studio is the center of project development in Xenko.

* Import assets, modify their parameters and see changes in real time in the preview window
* Organize assets by folder, attach tags and get notifications from modified assets on the disk
* Build a game executable and run it directly from Game Studio

It makes it easy to work in a team with the same asset management experience.

For game developers, the editor is also integrated with your Visual Studio projects, so you can seamlessly sync and switch back and forth.

You can then edit those assets in the Property Editor:

## Samples

Xenko comes with technical samples for each engine part (2D, 3D, Sprites, Fonts, UI, Audio, Input, etc) and a set of small games to help you make your own game. To open them, create a new project, and select the appropriate sample template.
