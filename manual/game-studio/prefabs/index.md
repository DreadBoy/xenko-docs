#Prefabs

Oftentimes, there are game objects that you want to re-use multiple times, e.g. props and scenery.
Certainly, you can copy-and-paste such objects. Yet, if you need to modify them later on, you will have to edit each duplicate individually.

More often than not you want to change object's properties once and apply these changes to all its instances.
That's when **Prefabs** come in handy.

**Prefabs** help you easily manage complex **Models**, multiple **Entities** and even entire game levels.
**Prefabs** allow you to:

* Combine separate elements of a complex **Model** for easy management.
* Combine several **Entities** to manage them as a single object.
* Create game levels faster and update them on the fly.

**Prefabs** help you easily scale game levels and re-use complex identical objects.
Watch how **Prefabs** can help you create a whole army of knights:
