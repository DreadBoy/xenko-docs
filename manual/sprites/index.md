# Sprites

2D applications are made of **sprites**.

Because loading lots of separate images takes up memory, it's more efficient to put sprites into a **sprite sheet**, a single image. You can then define regions of the sprite sheet as different sprites in Game Studio's Sprite Editor. After you define sprites, you can use scripts to render them.
