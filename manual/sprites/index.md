# Sprites

2D applications are made of **sprites**.

Because loading lots of separate sprite images takes up memory, it's more efficient to put sprites into a **sprite sheet**, a single image. You can then define regions of the sprite sheet as different sprites.

Then you can use scripts to render Sprites from the Sprite Sheets in a particular order.

You can also use sprites as UI elements.
